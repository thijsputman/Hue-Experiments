# Hue-Experiments

After "Hue'fying" most of my house I ran into some issues with the Hue apps available on Windows Phone. While both [Huerto](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/huetro-for-hue/9wzdncrfjj3t) (nice overall experience) and [OnHue](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/apps/onhue/9nblgggzk9wv) (great for tuning individual lights) are quite decent some features, especially with regards to scene-management (e.g. adding/removing lights, renaming), are sorely missing.

This repository contains a simple "app" (an HTML-file :smile:) I've hacked together to provide the scene-managment features I needed to properly "setup" my home. 

The Hue API is a bit peculair, but suprisinlgy fun to work with. Perhaps I'll try to take it a bit further in the future...
